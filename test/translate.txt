HA Mode 
Active-standby mode: In this mode, one of the two units, the active unit, deliver application, while the standby unit does not work until it takes over the application delivery service when the active unit fails. 
High-available Cluster: More than one AD units form a cluster, and deliver different services at the same time, monitoring health of one another. In case of failure of any unit, the applications being delivered from that failed unit will be taken over by another clustered unit. 
High-performance Cluster: More than one AD units form a cluster, high in performance. 
Select HA Mode 
Active-standby 
High-availability cluster 
High-performance cluster 
There are two units involved. One is Active and provides HA service, while the other is Standby and not provides HA service. When active unit fails, the standby unit changes to Active and takes over the service. 
In this mode, all of the features of an ADC are available. 
There are up to 16 ADC units involved. A service is running on one of the units, the Active unit, a second unit will be elected to work as Standby unit. When the Active unit fails, the standby unit changes to Active and takes over the service. However, services on different ADC units can run concurrently, as backups for one another when necessary. 
There are up to 8 ADC units involved. With link aggregation configured on the switch connected to the HA interface, data of a service will be assigned to each unit in the cluster to handle, dramatically improving performance. When there is any unit exits the cluster or any new unit is joined to the cluster, traffic will be fairly assigned among the clustered united to ensure business continuity. 
This mode is chosen for server load balancing, therefore, link load, IPv6, SSL connection multiplexing and dynamically routing are not supported.

Online Authorization 
Contact your supplier or call 400-806-6868 for authorization code and license key. 
Authorization Code: 
Tips 
1. Online authorization requires Internet connection. 
2. The product must be connected to the Internet always after being authorized online, otherwise use of relevant functionality will become restrictive. 
3. The authorization code and license key can only be used on one product. Before using them on another product, you may revoke this authorization first. 
Licensing succeeded 
Licensing failed 
The new authorization code and license key will overwrite the current code and key respectively. Are you sure to proceed? 
This operation requires the current authorization be revoked first and the Internet be connected. Are you sure to proceed and interrupt the business?
